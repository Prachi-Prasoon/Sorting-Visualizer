# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer (C++ with SDL2)

A visualization tool for different **sorting algorithms** implemented in **C++** using the **SDL2 library**.  
The project helps in understanding how various algorithms work by displaying their process step-by-step.

---

## ✨ Features
- Implements the following sorting algorithms:
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Bubble Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - Heap Sort
- Fixed list size of **130 elements**.
- Option to **randomize the list**.
- Sorts in **ascending order**.
- Visualization delays added for faster algorithms (like Merge Sort, Quick Sort) so the process can be observed clearly.  
  > ⚠️ Note: The visual speed does not reflect the exact time complexity.
